# Toolbox - Making Sysadmins Cry Since 2016!
Over my travels I have compiled a collection of tools that I find to be useful for diagnosing systems, and occasionally finding a fundamental flaw in their security settings. This is a modified version of this toolkit, with tools such as the [Nirsoft Launcher](https://launcher.nirsoft.net/) removed as I do not have the license to redistribute them.

Whilst I have tried to remove anything specific to the environment in which I created this, if you decide to download this, expect the following:
* Programs which just flat out don't work (I haven't tested everything in this, although I have tried to remove stuff which never worked).
* In-jokes in documentation (This has been distributed to several friends for testing purposes, and I may occasionally sarcastically mention their feedback).
* Tools which serve no clear purpose that no-one would ever use and that completely lack documentation.

Massive thanks to https://www.sevenforums.com/ for help creating the bulk of these tools.
